# There is nothing inside yet. Next week there'll be a 3D room for you to play with. Watch this repo!
- [] A 3D room
- [] A 3D room editor (Hoc462 Room Planner)
- [] The backend to share the room to everyone
It is very difficult because I am new to 3D, but I will learn as I am building this. Watch this, and if this is good, give me a star. Download the zip file, upload to a PHP-supported server and *ENJOY!*
